# PHP TODO App

## Description
In this repo, you can see the realization of my pet project - todo app with PHP.

## Environment to start project locally
To start a project locally you need to have next things on your local machine: 
* PHP 8.0 or above ([download PHP from official website](https://www.php.net/downloads.php))
* MySQL
* Apache web server

## Steps to start the project locally
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Start the Apache web server.
3. Start MySQL service.
4. In project folder fimd file with name [create_table.sql](https://github.com/utof0x/php-todo-app/blob/master/create_table.sql) and open it.
5. Copy the file's content and execute the SQL statement in your SQL editing tool (like MySQL workbench or phpMyAdmin). It should create a new database with the name **sql_todos** and this DB will contain table with name **todos**.
6. If you have DB and table mentioned above, you are ready to go, so open your browser, type [http://localhost/php-todo-app/](http://localhost/php-todo-app/) and have fun :)
